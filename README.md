# Wicket Hot reload

[Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org) is a Java Web framework providing clean separation between markup and logic.

This project allows hot reloading and auto compilations of classes (makes development faster)

# What's inside

Proof of concept of autocompilation and reloading of Wicket classes. You can run it via the Start class in test sources. 

If you edit the StartupPage class, you should see in your logs the application being reloaded and reflecting your changes.
